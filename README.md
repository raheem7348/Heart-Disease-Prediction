❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

📌 Project Overview

Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning–based classification system that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical parameters. The project uses a Logistic Regression model to analyze patient health data and provide accurate, interpretable predictions.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation in the healthcare domain.
